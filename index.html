            <p>After finishing my Master's Studies I worked as a research associate at the Institute of Computer Science of the University of Leipzig.
            Working interdisciplinarily in Digital Humanities and NLP, I pursued a PhD at the University of G&ouml;ttingen from 2015 until 2018 before I joined the Language 
            Technology Group at the German Research Center for Artifical Intelligence in Berlin.
            Since 2021 I am a post-doctoral researcher at the German Department of the Ruhr University Bochum.
            My interests revolve around the application of NLP methods to interdisciplinary research questions in the humanities (e.g., analysis of linguistic phenomenon via parallel texts, knowledge modeling, transfer-learning techniques).
